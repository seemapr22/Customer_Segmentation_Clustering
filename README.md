# Customer_Segmentation_Clustering

## Context
In this project, I have performed an unsupervised clustering of data on the customer's records from a groceries firm's database. Customer segmentation is the practice of separating customers into groups that reflect similarities among customers in each cluster. I have divided customers into segments to optimize the significance of each customer to the business and to modify products according to distinct needs and behaviours of the customers. It also helps the business to cater to the concerns of different types of customers.
